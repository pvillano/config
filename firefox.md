 * Load about:config in the Firefox address bar.
 * Confirm that you will be careful if the warning page is displayed.
 * Use the search field to find the following preferences, and to modify them once they are displayed:
     * gfx.webrender.all -- Set this to TRUE to enable WebRender, or to FALSE to disable it.
     * gfx.webrender.software -- This preferences determines if the CPU is used. If this is set to TRUE, WebRender will use the CPU, if set to FALSE, it will use the GPU but only if the GPU is capable.
 * Restart the Firefox web browser.
